Welcome to the enhanced version of Road Fighter, an arcade racing game built using Unity. Get ready for an adrenaline-packed experience as you navigate through challenging roads, and compete for the highest score!

# Unity Game Installation

## Prerequisites:

1. **Unity Hub Installed:**
   - Download and install Unity Hub from the [official Unity website](https://unity.com/).

2. **Unity Editor Installed:**
   - Open Unity Hub and install the Unity Editor version that you want to use.

## Download and Integrate Code from GitHub:

1. **Clone Repository:**
   - Open a terminal or Git Bash.
   - Use the following command to clone the GitHub repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/egeda9/road-fighter.git
     ```

2. **Open Unity Hub:**
   - Launch Unity Hub on your Windows machine.

3. **Open Project:**
   - Click on the "Projects" tab in Unity Hub.
   - Click "Add" to add an existing Unity project or create a new one.

4. **Select Project:**
   - Choose the Unity project you want to work on from the list.

5. **Copy Repository Files:**
   - Copy the files from the cloned GitHub repository into your Unity project directory.

6. **Unity Editor:**
   - Open the Unity Editor.

7. **Build Settings:**
   - Go to "File" > "Build Settings" in the Unity Editor.

8. **Platform Selection:**
   - Choose the target platform for your game (e.g., PC, Mac & Linux Standalone).
   - Click on "Switch Platform" to set the target platform.

9. **Player Settings:**
   - Configure the player settings according to your requirements. This includes things like resolution, graphics settings, etc.

10. **Build the Game:**
    - Click on "Build" to create the executable for your game.
    - Choose a location to save the build files.

11. **Run the Game:**
    - Navigate to the folder where you saved the build files.
    - Locate the executable file (e.g., Road-Fighter.exe) and double-click to run the game.

## Troubleshooting:

- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to clone the repository.

- Check for any specific setup instructions or dependencies mentioned in the GitHub repository README.

- If the GitHub repository contains additional assets, make sure to include them in your Unity project.

## Game Controls
<ul>
    <li>W or Up Arrow: Accelerate</li>
    <li>S or Down Arrow: Brake/Reverse</li>
    <li>A or Left Arrow: Steer Left</li>
    <li>D or Right Arrow: Steer Right</li>
    <li>P: Pause</li>
    <li>Esc: Quit</li>
</ul>

## Gameplay

Drive through diverse environments, avoiding traffic and obstacles. Your goal is to complete 3 laps with the highest score. Be cautious - collisions reduce your score, and the game ends when your fuel runs out or you complete 3 laps.

## Scoring

Score points by covering distance and performing skillful maneuvers. Bonus points are awarded for passing checkpoints, completing laps and navigating through challenging sections. Compete with friends and aim for the top of the leaderboard!

<ul>
    <li>Passing checkpoints: +150P and +500F</li>
    <li>Complete lap: +150P and +500F</li>
    <li>Collision: -100P</li>
    <li>Wrong way: -100P</li>
</ul>

# Unity Game Architecture

## Overview
A Unity game typically follows a component-based architecture, where different game elements are represented as GameObjects containing various Components. Unity uses a scene-based approach to organize and manage game elements.

## Core Components

### 1. **GameObject:**
   - Basic building block of Unity scenes.
   - Acts as a container for Components.
   - Can represent characters, objects, cameras, lights, etc.

### 2. **Transform:**
   - Specifies the position, rotation, and scale of a GameObject.
   - Every GameObject has a Transform component.

### 3. **Collider:**
   - Handles collision detection.
   - Determines when GameObjects interact with each other.

### 4. **Rigidbody:**
   - Simulates physics for GameObjects.
   - Enables realistic movement and interactions.

## Game Logic

### 1. **Scripts:**
   - Written in C#.
   - Attached to GameObjects to define behavior.
   - Handle input, game logic, and interactions.

### 2. **MonoBehaviour:**
   - Base class for Unity scripts.
   - Provides functions like `Start()`, `Update()`, and `OnCollisionEnter()`.

## Rendering

### 1. **Mesh Renderer:**
   - Displays 3D models or sprites.
   - Defines how GameObjects appear visually.

### 2. **Material:**
   - Determines the surface properties of GameObjects.
   - Can include textures, colors, and shaders.

### 3. **Camera:**
   - Defines the player's view.
   - Captures and displays the game scene.

## Audio

### 1. **Audio Source:**
   - Emits sounds.
   - Attached to GameObjects to provide audio effects.

### 2. **Audio Listener:**
   - Represents the "ears" of the player.
   - Listens for audio in the game world.

## Scenes and Navigation

### 1. **Scene:**
   - Represents a level or a distinct section of the game.
   - Contains GameObjects, lights, cameras, etc.

### 2. **Navigation:**
   - Managed using NavMesh for pathfinding.
   - Controls how characters move in the game world.

## User Interface (UI)

### 1. **Canvas:**
   - Container for UI elements.
   - Holds items like text, buttons, and images.

### 2. **UI Text, Image, Button:**
   - Represent different UI components.
   - Used to create interactive interfaces.
